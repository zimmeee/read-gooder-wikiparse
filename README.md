# read-gooder-wikiparse
Parsing wikipedia content into plain text and creating small reading comprehension questions

## Dependencies

### Wikimedia REST API
This utility makes heavy use of the [Wikimedia REST API](http://rest.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/v1/?doc#!). In particular, we use the [HTML endpoint](http://rest.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/v1/?doc#!/Page_content/page_html__title__get) which allows you to retrieve the latest html for a wikipedia page title.

### Stanford Parser
You also need to install the [Stanford parser](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/wiki/Installing-Third-Party-Software) so you can use it from nltk


## JSON Format

I'll try to document this a couple ways to see which one makes more sense. 

### Grammar-like documentation
```
<document> ::=
	"header": STRING,
	"sections": <sections> | <paragraphs>

<section> ::=
	?"header": STRING,
	<paragraphs> | <section> | <paragraphs>,<section>

<paragraphs> ::=
	"sentences": [<sentences>]

<sentences> ::=
	[<sentence>]

<sentence> ::=
	"num_words": INT,
	"sentence_parts": [<sentence_parts>]

<sentence_parts> ::=
	"indent": INT,
	"text": STRING
```

### English-like documentation
```
