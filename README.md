## JSON Format

I'll try to document this a couple ways to see which one makes more sense.

### Grammar-like documentation
```
<document> ::=
	"header": STRING,
	"sections": <sections> | <paragraphs>

<section> ::=
	?"header": STRING,
	<paragraphs> | <section> | <paragraphs>,<section>

<paragraphs> ::=
	"sentences": [<sentences>]

<sentences> ::=
	[<sentence>]

<sentence> ::=
	"num_words": INT,
	"sentence_parts": [<sentence_parts>]

<sentence_parts> ::=
	"indent": INT,
	"text": STRING
```

### English-like documentation
```
